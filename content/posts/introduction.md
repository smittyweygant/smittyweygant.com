## Introduction

Hi, I am Smitty, and this is my blog. I decided to start writing to chronicle several aspects of my life that, to put it mildly, have been in transition. I've thought about writing for a long time, and am excited to reflect on my thoughts and experiences. In beginning this process, I realize that there are so many parts of my life that I want to share, so the challenge has been to get started. So here I am. 

Three years ago, my wife and I were each enjoying success and fulfillment with new jobs. My stepdaughter and son-in-law were anticipating their first child, and we were excited about becoming grandparents. It was a time when I felt we were making our individual and shared dreams a reality. In a matter of weeks, my marriage of 22 years began to unravel. I lost my parter and the trust, respect, and bond that I had treasured for 24 years. My family as I knew it was gone, leaving me adrift for the next 15 months. 

Leading up to that time, I had left a very rewarding job to participate in the early stage growth of a tech start-up. I was the first sales hire, and played a key role in building the "go to market" organization, a team that grew from 0 to 50 people, 25-1500+ customers, < $1M to over $20M in revenue in under 3 years. I hired 16 sales engineers around the globe, a group of well liked rock stars and great humans. I promoted two people into management roles to form a leadership team. It was the most exciting and rewarding phase of my career. 

With my identity and sense of home shattered, I felt alone and without support. In the 15 months following the separation, my well-being and health were decimated. I had allowed many friendships to languish. I had thrown everything into my work, which was a poor substitute for family & friends. I was utterly unprepared to face the biggest change in my life. 

By the fall of 2023, I had come to grips with the end of my marriage. I did not know who I was as an individual on my own, so I decided to fulfill a dream and live life as a 'digital nomad.' My plan: cross the country, explore the outdoors, spend quality time with old friends and family, and discover who I might become on my own. On New Years Eve in 2023, I purchased an Airstream trailer that became my mobile residence for 2024. 

I started my 'full time' existence in January, and hit the road in early April. I crossed the US twice and visited friends and family. I discovered some incredible places along the way. I frequently did not know where I would stop or stay for the night, and and felt liberated. Overnight stops took place at rest areas, wineries, ranches, farms, and a nuclear missile silo. 

When I needed a place to be for a while, I took residency in campgrounds, RV parks and two race tracks. I squatted on BLM and Army Corps land, and the property of dear friends. I sought out live music and the peace of being in nature everywhere. It was amazing. 

Spending time with people quickly became the most enriching and important part of the trip. A few I hadn't seen in months, years, and even decades. My beloved dog, my companion and co-pilot died in June. He was 13 and his passing left me completely on my own. 

I learned to take off my mask and be vulnerable, be authentic, be me. I openly shared and traded experiences, feelings, hopes, and dreams with anyone who would talk and listen. I felt love, joy and connection everywhere. A profound sense of gratitude grew in me, which is overflowing at this moment. 

There's a lot to share, so I'd best get to it.

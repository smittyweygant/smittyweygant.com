## Introduction

Hi, I’m Smitty, and welcome to my blog. I decided to start writing to chronicle several aspects of my life that, to put it mildly, have been in transition. I've thought about writing for a long time and am excited to finally reflect on my thoughts and experiences. There are so many parts of my life I want to share, and the challenge has simply been getting started. So here I am. 

Three years ago, my wife and I were each enjoying success and fulfillment in our new jobs. My stepdaughter and son-in-law were anticipating their first child, and we were thrilled at the prospect of becoming grandparents. Despite many of our dreams coming true, there were unresolved issues beneath the surface. In the span of just a few weeks in July and August 2022, my marriage began to unravel. I lost my partner and the trust, respect, and bond I had treasured for 24 years. My family as I knew it was shattered, leaving me adrift for the next 15 months. 

During that same period, I had left a rewarding job to join the early-stage growth of a tech start-up. As the first sales hire, I played a key role in building the "go-to-market" organization. During my tenure we grew from 0 to 50 people, customers from 25 to 1,500+, and revenue from under $1M to over $20M in less than three years. I hired 16 sales engineers around the globe — a team of well-liked rock stars and incredible humans —and promoted two of them into management roles to form a leadership team. It was the most exciting and rewarding phase of my career. 

However, in the 15 months following my separation, my well-being and health were decimated. I had allowed many friendships to languish, throwing myself entirely into my work, which proved to be a poor substitute for family and friends. I was utterly unprepared to face the biggest change of my life. I felt alone and, despite having supportive friends and family, isolated myself. 

By the winter of 2023, I came to terms with the end of my marriage. I struggled to understand and express my identity as an individual. I felt wanderlust and a desire for connection, so I decided to fulfill a long-held dream: living life as a digital nomad. My plan was to travel across the country, work my normal schedule, explore the outdoors, spend quality time with old friends and family, and discover who I could become on my own. On 12/31/2023, I purchased an Airstream trailer that would become my mobile residence for 2024. 

I started my full-time nomadic life in January and hit the road in early April. I crossed the US twice, visiting friends and family and discovering incredible places along the way. I frequently didn’t know where I would stop or stay for the night, and I felt liberated. My overnight stops ranged from rest areas, wineries, ranches, and farms to a nuclear missile silo. 

When I needed to settle down for a while, I stayed at campgrounds, RV parks, and even two racetracks. I camped on BLM land, Army Corps property, and the homes of dear friends. Along the way, I sought out live music and the peace of being in nature. It was transformative and utterly amazing. 

The most enriching part of my journey was spending time with people—some I hadn’t seen in months, years, or even decades. In June, my beloved dog, who had been my companion and co-pilot for 13 years, passed away. His loss left me truly on my own. 

During this time, I learned to take off my mask and embrace vulnerability, authenticity, and my true self. I openly shared and exchanged experiences, feelings, hopes, and dreams with anyone willing to talk and listen. I felt love, joy, and connection everywhere I went. A profound sense of gratitude began to grow within me, and it continues to overflow. 

From here, I intend to chronicle my travels and personal discovery. I also plan to do some professional writing. There's a lot to share, so I'd best get to it.

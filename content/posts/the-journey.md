I have always had a strong feeling of wanderlust - a desire to be on the open road, on my own terms, taking in the world. I've been fortunate to have been able to visit so many places, and always relished family vacations, road trips with friends, work travel, and solo exploring. The more I traveled, the more I wanted it to be integral to my life. As I came to grips with the end of a long and happy marriage in 2022-23, I realized I had the opportunity to fulfill a dream of living on the road, as a nomad. I am excited to share how that dream became real in 2024 when I started living and working 'full-time' from the road. 

There are many aspects of this change in life and lifestyle that I want to reflect on and share.

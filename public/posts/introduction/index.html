<p>Hi, I am Smitty, and this is my blog. I decided to start writing to chronicle several aspects of my life that, to put it mildly, have been in transition. I&rsquo;ve thought about writing for a long time, and am excited to reflect on my thoughts and experiences. There are so many parts of my life that I want to share, and the challenge has been to simply get started. So here I am.</p>
<p>Three years ago, my wife and I were each enjoying success and fulfillment with new jobs. My stepdaughter and son-in-law were anticipating their first child, and we were excited about becoming grandparents. It was a time when I felt we were making our individual and shared dreams a reality. In a matter of weeks in July &amp; August 2022, my marriage began to unravel. I lost my partner and the trust, respect, and bond I had treasured for 24 years. My family as I knew it was shattered, leaving me adrift for the next 15 months.</p>
<p>Leading up to that time, I had left a very rewarding job to participate in the early stage growth of a tech start-up. I was the first sales hire, and played a key role in building the &ldquo;go to market&rdquo; organization, a team that grew from 0 to 50 people, 25-1500+ customers, &lt; $1M to over $20M in revenue in under 3 years. I hired 16 sales engineers around the globe, a group of well liked rock stars and great humans. I promoted two people into management roles to form a leadership team. It was the most exciting and rewarding phase of my career.</p>
<p>In the 15 months following the separation, my well-being and health were decimated. I had allowed many friendships to languish. I had thrown everything into my work, which was a poor substitute for family &amp; friends. I was utterly unprepared to face the biggest change in my life. I felt alone and isolated myself, despite having supportive friends and family.</p>
<p>By the winter of 2023, I came to grips with the end of my marriage. I did not know who I was as an individual on my own, so I decided to fulfill a dream and live life as a &lsquo;digital nomad.&rsquo; My plan: cross the country, explore the outdoors, spend quality time with old friends and family, and discover who I might become on my own. On 12/31/2023, I purchased an Airstream trailer that would become my mobile residence for 2024.</p>
<p>I started my &lsquo;full time&rsquo; existence in January, and hit the road in early April. I crossed the US twice and visited my friends and family. I discovered some incredible places along the way. I frequently did not know where I would stop or stay for the night, and and felt liberated. Overnight stops took place at rest areas, wineries, ranches, farms, and even a nuclear missile silo.</p>
<p>When I needed a place to be for a while, I took residency in campgrounds, RV parks and two race tracks. I squatted on BLM and Army Corps land, and the property of dear friends. I sought out live music and the peace of being in nature everywhere. It was liberating, transformative, and utterly amazing.</p>
<p>Spending time with people was the most enriching and important part of the trip. A few I hadn&rsquo;t seen in months, years, and even decades. My beloved dog, my companion and co-pilot died in June. He was 13 and his passing left me completely on my own.</p>
<p>I learned to take off my mask and be vulnerable, be authentic, be me. I openly shared and traded experiences, feelings, hopes, and dreams with anyone who would talk and listen. I felt love, joy and connection everywhere. A profound sense of gratitude grew in me, which is overflowing at this moment.</p>
<p>From here, I intend to chronicle my travels and personal discovery from 2024.There&rsquo;s a lot to share, so I&rsquo;d best get to it.</p>
